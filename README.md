Very basic wrapper around [elk.zone](https://elk.zone) using [Tauri](https://tauri.app). 

Small executable, cross platform, uses your native built-in webview implementation. 

Eventually it would be cool to pull from the [Elk GitHub](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) and integrate straight w/ it, but for now it's just the wrapper.
