Very basic wrapper around [elk.zone](https://elk.zone) using [Tauri](https://tauri.app). 

Small executable, cross platform, uses your native built-in webview implementation. 

Eventually it would be cool to pull from the [Elk GitHub](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) and integrate straight w/ it, but for now it's just the wrapper. 

### Installing
You can download from the releases [here](https://github.com/BobbyMcWho/elk_native/releases). 

Until code signing is set up, you will have to bypass your OS's warnings when opening the app. 

## Mac
Open the Mac app and use [the unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac) workaround. 

## Windows
